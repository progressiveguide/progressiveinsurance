    <h2>New Car Insurance: What You Should Know</h2>
    <p>
      New car insurance is designed for recently purchased or leased vehicles. Insurance
      requirements often depend on whether the vehicle is financed, leased, or owned outright.
      Many lenders require full coverage auto insurance to protect the vehicle’s value.
    </p>

    <p>
      When requesting a new auto insurance quote, drivers are usually asked to provide vehicle
      identification details, estimated mileage, garaging location, and prior insurance history.
      These factors help determine pricing and eligibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Full Coverage Is Common for New Cars</h3>
    <p>
      Full coverage car insurance typically includes liability, collision, and comprehensive
      coverage. This combination helps cover damages to other vehicles, property, and the insured
      vehicle itself. New car owners often choose full coverage quotes to reduce out-of-pocket
      expenses after accidents or unexpected events.

  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section id="auto-insurance-quotes">
    <h2>How Auto Insurance Quotes Are Calculated</h2>

      updated or verified during policy issuance.

    <p>
      Common factors affecting auto insurance quotes include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vehicle make, model, and year</li>
      <li>Driver age and driving record</li>
      <li>Location and garaging address</li>
      <li>Coverage limits and deductibles</li>
      <li>Previous insurance history</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Understanding Auto Insurance Coverage Options</h2>
  <p>
    Auto insurance coverage determines how financial protection applies after an accident,
    theft, or unexpected vehicle damage. When requesting Progressive auto insurance quotes,
    drivers typically choose between liability-only policies or full coverage options based
    on vehicle value and personal risk tolerance.
  </p>

  <h3>Liability Auto Insurance</h3>
  <p>
    Liability coverage is designed to pay for injuries or property damage caused to others.
    It is required in most states and forms the foundation of any auto insurance policy.
    Liability-only quotes are often lower in cost but do not cover damage to the insured vehicle.
  </p>

  <h3>Full Coverage Auto Insurance</h3>
  <p>
    Full coverage auto insurance (𝟴𝟱𝟲)•𝟵𝟬𝟬•𝟳𝟴𝟯𝟰 generally combines liability, collision, and comprehensive
    coverage. This option is commonly selected for new car insurance policies or financed
    vehicles. Full coverage quotes tend to be higher but provide broader financial protection.
